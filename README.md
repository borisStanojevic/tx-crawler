Steps to run the project:

- Navigate to the root directory of the repo
- run 'docker-compose up --build' command
- Open the browser
- As an example type in http://localhost:3000/api/transactions/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd?startBlock=9000000 in the URL and hit enter 
- Voila

*I tried to make it relatively simple. Many additional things, which we can discuss further, can be done.*
